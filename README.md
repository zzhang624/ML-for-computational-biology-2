Comparison  of  different  clustering  algorithms and Autoencoder


K-means  clustering,  spectral  clustering  and  Leiden  clustering(a  modified version of louvain clustering algorithm). We will play around with those three algorithms
on different datasets,  and see how those algorithms perform in different circumstances.

Use autoencoder to do dimensionality reduction on a human peripheral blood mononu-clear cells(PBMCs) dataset.
